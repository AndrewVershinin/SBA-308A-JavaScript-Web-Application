# SBA 308A: â€¨JavaScript Web Application

## Introduction
This assessment measures your capability to implement advanced JavaScript tools and features in a practical manner. You have creative freedom in the topic, material, and purpose of the web application you will be developing, so have fun with it! However, remember to plan the scope of your project to the timeline you have been given.
This assessment has a total duration of two (2) days. This is a take-home assessment.
You have two total days (including weekends and holidays) to work on this assessment. This assessment will be due at 5:00pm on the second day after it is assigned. Your instructor may provide you with class time to work on the assessment, schedule permitting.

## Objectives
- Use asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.
- Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop.
- Generate asynchronous code using Promises and async/await syntax.
- Use fetch and/or Axios to interact with an external web API.
- Organize files using modules and imports.

## Instructions
You will create a small single-page web application. The topic and content of this application is entirely up to you; be creative!

Your work will be graded according to the technical requirements listed in the following section. Creativity and effort always work in your favor, so feel free to go beyond the scope of the listed requirements if you have the time.

Keep things simple. Like most projects you will encounter, you should finish the absolute minimum requirements first, and then add additional features and complexity if you have the time to do so. This will also help you understand what you can get done in a specific allotment of time if you were to be asked to do something similar in the future.
Once you have an idea in mind, approach your design through the user's perspective. User experience is one of the most important aspects of successful web design. If users enjoy their time on with your application, they are more likely to trust whatever services or information you offer, and more likely to come back and use the application again in the future.

You will need access to an external API in order to complete the requirements listed below. Since the content of the API will largely determine the content of your application, it should be chosen first and carefully. You can look for available APIs across the internet, but make sure they include features that will allow you to implement the requirements listed below.

## Web application describe

I have created a web application with which you can choose a cat for yourself according to such parameters as:

- Temperament;
- Child Friendly;
- Dog Friendly;
- Grooming;
  
The user can also find the breed card through the search bar and upload a photo of the cat to his account.
